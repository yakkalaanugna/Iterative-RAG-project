# Adaptive Iterative RAG for Telecom Log Root Cause Analysis
We analyze the interaction between retrieval quality and reasoning performance in iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, showing that improvements in retrieval precision do not necessarily translate into improved downstream reasoning accuracy.

## TL;DR

- **What:** Automatically identifies root causes in telecom network logs using iterative retrieval and LLM-based reasoning  
- **Why:** Single-pass RAG fails to capture multi-file causal chains; fixed iteration wastes computation  
- **How:** Query → Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + Dense) → Cross-Encoder Reranking → Confidence-Guided Iteration → LLM Analysis
  
- This work complements existing telecom RAG systems by focusing on the relationship between retrieval quality and downstream reasoning performance.
---

## Motivation

- Noisy logs — vendor-specific formats, inconsistent timestamps, and error codes embedded in free text  
- Implicit causal chains — failures span multiple files (e.g., RRC failure → bearer cancellation → UE release) without explicit links  
- Multi-step reasoning — tracing failures requires cross-file correlation beyond single-pass retrieval

## System Overview

```
Query → Log Parser → Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + Dense)
                         ↓
                  Cross-Encoder Reranking (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2)
                         ↓
                  LLM Root Cause Analysis (Llama 3.3 70B)
                         ↓
                  Confidence Scoring (4-signal weighted)
                         ↓
                  ┌─ High confidence? → Return best result
                  └─ Low confidence?  → Refine query, iterate (max 3)
```

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hybrid Retrieval** | Retrieves 20–30 candidates using BM25 + dense embeddings |
| **Cross-Encoder Reranking** | `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` (22M params) rescores (query, document) pairs; improves precision without affecting recall |
| **Iterative Refinement** | LLM rewrites query using discovered error codes/timestamps → retrieves corroborating evidence |
| **Confidence Stopping** | 4-signal score (retrieval quality, completeness, evidence density, consistency) → stops early or iterates |

---

## Key Features

- Confidence-gated adaptive iteration (max 3 rounds, early stopping)
- Hybrid retrieval with cross-encoder reranking (no domain fine-tuning needed)
- LLM-based query refinement between iterations
- Structured output: root cause, severity, supporting logs with file/line/timestamp, reasoning chain
- Persistent incident memory for cross-session learning
- Telecom log parser (eGate, UEC, RAIN, syslog, archives)
- Built-in evaluation framework (Precision@K, Recall@K, root cause accuracy)
- Streamlit dashboard for interactive analysis

## Results

Preliminary results on a small corpus (3 log files, ~30 records, 3 queries). These results are indicative and not statistically significant.

| Method | Precision@K | Root Cause Acc. | Latency |
|--------|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| Baseline RAG | ~0.80 | ~0.67 | ~2.5s |
| Fixed Iterative | ~0.69 | ~0.67 | ~20s |
| **Adaptive (ours)** | **0.80–0.85** | ~0.67 | ~16s |

- **Observation:** Precision@K — improves primarily due to cross-encoder reranking.
- **Unchanged:** Root Cause Accuracy — same frozen LLM across all methods. Better retrieval ≠ better reasoning.
- **Tradeoff:** ~16s vs ~2.5s latency (cross-encoder + iteration overhead).

## Limitations

- **Small dataset** — 3 queries, ~30 records. Indicative, not statistically significant.
- **Latency** — cross-encoder + iteration adds ~13s over baseline. Not optimized for real-time.
- **Fixed LLM ceiling** — root cause accuracy bounded by frozen Llama-3.3-70b. Better retrieval ≠ better reasoning.
- **No domain fine-tuning** — off-the-shelf embedding models. Telecom-adapted models could help.
- **Incomplete ablation** — reranking dominates Precision@K gains, but full ±reranker × ±iteration study not done.

---

## Future Work

- Larger telecom datasets with statistical significance testing
- Ablation study: reranker vs. iteration contributions
- Domain-adapted embeddings for telecom vocabulary
- Latency optimization (distillation, candidate pruning)
- Graph-based retrieval for explicit causal chain modeling
